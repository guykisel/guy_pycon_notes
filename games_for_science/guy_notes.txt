create computer models of behavior
compare models to actual behavior
physics games are good for comparing human reasoning

hypothesis: physics engine in your head, performing simulations
-simulations are not exact
-simulations have some randomness
-the world has uncertainty

use video games as theories and as experiments
-create model
-create stimuli
-run experiments
-perform data analysis

game-based experiments are more engaging, experimentees have more fun
