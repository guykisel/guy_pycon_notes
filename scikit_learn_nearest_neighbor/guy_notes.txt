70% clean and standardize data
20% preprocessing, training, validation of data
10% analyze and visualize data


scikit-learn algorithm cheat sheet
-super useful for figuring out what to do with scikit-learn depending on data and needs


evernote uses scikit-learn
-distinguish recipes from work notes
-naive bayes classification


keep your feature set low in supervised learning


k-NN : k nearest neighbor
simplest machine learning algorithm
lazy algorithm - doesnt run computation until you give it a new data point

demo: use k-nn for supervised learning
look at k nearest neighbors
each neighbor has equal weight OR each neighbor is weighted by distance
minimum training, so high cost for new data
correlation can be falsely high

demo problem:
identifying irises based on iris petals and sepals (section below petals)
