-classification

unsupervised learning
-understanding your data

this talk is mostly supervised learning

1. set aside a validation set

2. build pipelines, optimize parameters
-sequence of operations

readability library - pull unrelated stuff out of html text

urlparse library - get hostname for url

machine learning is now in libraries, can be used as engineering instead of science
