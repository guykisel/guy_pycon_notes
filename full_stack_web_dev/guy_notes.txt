python is often one part of a much larger system
can be confusing when you get out of the application layer - lots of pieces

typical web app
dev, staging, prod, deploy
helpful python libraries

stack:
os
web server
db
application language

example:
apache mod_wsgi / nginx gunicorn
python
postgres

logging
-loggly
-splunk

no such thing as a small change to a large system
-should have a separate dev/staging env for each app
