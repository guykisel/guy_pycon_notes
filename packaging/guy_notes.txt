be able to install
be able to distribute
know how to learn more


name of distribution on pypi doesnt always match name used on import

should not be sudo pip installing

pip install --user installs to user home directory


asheesh laroia - presenter

pip install --editable .    - installs from local files


distutils.core vs setuptools (dont use distribute)
distutils - safe and featureless
setuptools - comes with pip, more features

dont use --user with virtualenv


sudo apt-get build-dep python-lxml        - downloads dependencies for building


kitsune vendor library - look up for django project distribution of openhatch

to set up wheel, go to pip2014.com

conda - alternative package manager

pypi-install - makes a .deb file

dh-virtualenv takes requirement.txt file and creates virtualenv installable as .deb file
